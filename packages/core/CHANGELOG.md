## [Unreleased]

## [1.4.0] - 2020-10-01

## [1.3.0] - 2020-08-31

- `RemoteRoot#createComponent()` now checks whether the passed component is supported if the `components` option was provided `createRemoteRoot()` ([pull request](https://github.com/Shopify/remote-ui/pull/20)).

## [1.2.2] - 2020-06-25

- Fixed the type of `RemoteReceiver#get()` to correctly indicate that an attached element may be `null` ([pull request](https://github.com/Shopify/remote-ui/pull/17)).
